📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes Diwali festival sales data to uncover customer purchasing behavior, regional demand, and product performance. By applying Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization, the study transforms raw transactional records into actionable business insights.

🎯 **Objectives**

-	Identify high value customer segments (gender, age group, marital status, occupation).
-	Highlight top performing states and zones driving festive sales.
-	Evaluate product categories and best selling products.
-	Understand the relationship between orders and revenue.
-	Provide business recommendations for marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

-	Rows: 11,243
-	Columns: 15 (after cleaning, 12 useful columns retained)
-	Key Features:
-	Customer demographics: Gender, Age Group, Marital_Status, Occupation
-	Geographic details: State, Zone
-	Product details: Product_ID, Product_Category
-	Transaction details: Orders, Amount

🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The project answers 15 key visualization questions, including:
1.	Total sales by Gender
2.	Spending by Age Group
